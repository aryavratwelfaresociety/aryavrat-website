    <h2>Focus Areas</h2>
    <p>A key focus of Aryavrat Welfare Society is water conservation. The organization undertakes projects that revive ancient water management techniques like stepwells (baolis), rainwater harvesting systems, and community water storage practices rooted in Indian tradition. Through awareness drives, workshops, and field programs, it encourages responsible water usage and educates communities about the importance of preserving water resources.</p>
    <p>The society is also a strong proponent of the Indian Knowledge System, which includes traditional sciences, arts, health systems like Ayurveda, and classical education methodologies. It collaborates with scholars, educational institutions, and cultural bodies to preserve and promote this rich heritage.</p>
    <p>In addition to grassroots work, Aryavrat Welfare Society regularly organizes national and international seminars, webinars, and conferences on pressing social issues such as education, environment, health, women empowerment, and cultural preservation. These events serve as platforms for dialogue, research dissemination, and policy recommendations.</p>
    <p>Through its multifaceted initiatives, Aryavrat Welfare Society is playing a vital role in shaping a sustainable, culturally rooted, and socially responsible future.</p>
